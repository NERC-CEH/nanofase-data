# NanoFASE Data Tools

Tools for parsing data related to the [NanoFASE model](https://github.com/nerc-ceh/nanofase).

**April 2019, input data changes:** The hierarchical NetCDF file generated by `input-data-compilation.py` is being deprecated in favour of a flat NetCDF file. The motivation behind this is mainly to speed up data input, but also so geographical input data complies with [CF conventions](http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html). Watch this space.
